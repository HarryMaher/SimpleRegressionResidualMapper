# Simple Regression Residual Mapper
Maps of residuals of simple regressions. Using Seattle data.


A front/back end cartography project for an advanced python course. 
Turning out to be a mostly JS project, but this is very much a work in progress.

## To do:
- mouseover datapoint fire mouseover on map and vice versa
    -- ideally not using jquery because already heavy.
- figure out why some residual standard deviations are NaN
- figure out how to avoid some maps turning completely purple? Zeroes somewhere?
- is the legend getting recalculated?
- ~~legend into standard deviations calculated~~
- ~~have titles for x and y axes of graph and make them prominent~~ 
- ~~make an interface for switching between various datasets for x and y variables -- drop downs?- make the interface actually change data~~
- get more data, clean
- An entire back-end to allow for more datasets? PostgreSQL?
- Give user option to map x or y variables, and difference between x and y?
